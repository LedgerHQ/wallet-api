## Target Audience

The Wallet API Client is tailored for developers seeking to build Live Apps for embedding within Ledger Live. It ensures smooth communication between the Live App and the user’s Ledger hardware wallet through [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live).

Similar to the React variant of this library, we anticipate expanding its capabilities to support additional use cases such as web apps connected to Ledger wallets through the [Ledger Extension](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-extension), but this is not yet supported.

## Overview

The Wallet API Client library empowers your Live App to:

- **Seamlessly Connect with Ledger Wallets**: Establish a smooth connection to Ledger hardware wallets and access essential wallet information, via Ledger Live.

- **Efficiently Manage Blockchain Accounts**: Handle multiple blockchain accounts effortlessly, including retrieving a list of accounts or requesting specific accounts from the user.

- **Securely Sign Messages**: Utilize the user's private key to sign arbitrary messages which can be employed for user authentication, address verification, and other purposes.

- **Support an Array of Cryptocurrencies**: The library boasts support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, and more.

- **Ensure Type Safety**: Incorporate TypeScript types to bolster the development process, making it more robust and error-resistant.
