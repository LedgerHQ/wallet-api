# Getting Started with Ledger's Wallet API

Welcome to the getting started guide for Ledger's Wallet API. We are excited to have you onboard and look forward to
seeing what you'll create.

Ledger's Wallet API can be integrated with both client and server-side applications, offering you flexibility and
enabling diverse use-cases.

## Installation

Let's begin by installing the base package.

You can use your favorite package manager, npm, yarn or pnpm, to install the `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-client
```

### Using Ledger's Wallet API with React

We offer a specific package to facilitate easy integration of the Wallet API:
`@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client-react`.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-client-react
```

This package provides handy React hooks to interact with Ledger's Wallet API.

### Testing with Simulator

To test the Wallet API without connecting to the Ledger Live App directly, you can use the
`@ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator
```

Remember, this package currently only functions with server-side applications due to a dependency requiring the usage
of `process`.

## Node.js Polyfills Setup

### Why do you need polyfills?

Modern bundlers like Vite and Webpack 5+ no longer include Node.js polyfills by default. Since Ledger's Wallet API uses Node.js modules like `Buffer` for cryptographic operations, you'll need to add these polyfills manually when building for the browser.

### Setting up with Vite

If you're using Vite, install the `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` plugin:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-node-polyfills
```

Then add it to your `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { nodePolyfills } from "vite-plugin-node-polyfills";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    nodePolyfills({
      // Whether to polyfill `node:` protocol imports.
      protocolImports: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Setting up with Webpack 5+

For Webpack 5+, you can add polyfills to your `webpack.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    fallback: {
      buffer: require.resolve("buffer"),
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],
    }),
  ],
};
```

You'll also need to install the polyfill package:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install buffer
```

Now that you've successfully installed the necessary packages, you're ready to start crafting with Ledger's Wallet
API. In the next page, we'll guide you through the process of setting up and configuring the Wallet API in your
application.
